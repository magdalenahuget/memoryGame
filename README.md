-----------------------------------
Game play:
1. Program should load a text file with words that will be covered and doubled
during the game. There is a file attached ‚Äùwords.txt", which you need to use.
2. Program should ask the user to choose between two difficulty levels. Easy -
program loads 4 randomly selected words to discover and player has 10
chances to reveal all memory, or Hard - user needs to guess location of 8
randomly selected word pairs and has 15 chances to reveal all word pairs.
3. After difficulty level pick, User gets displayed matrix of covered words.

-----------------------------------
Level: easy\
Guess chances: 10\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 2 3 4\
A X X X X\
B X X X X

-----------------------------------

4. Then the program asks the user to choose the first word to uncover, by
coordinates ex. A1. which triggers the logic responsible for uncovering words.

5. After the player enters coordinates, the program should display a matrix with an
uncovered single word.

-----------------------------------
Level: easy\
Guess chances: 10\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 2 3 4\
A Tomato X X X\
B X X X X

-----------------------------------

6. Next, the player should be prompted to enter second coordinates ex. B4. If the words
match, words stay uncovered and the gameplay continues until the player loses all
chances or unreveal all words. If the words don't match, the words get covered again
and the player loses one guess chance.

-----------------------------------
Intended effects:
- You can choose two times from one row in one round.
- You can duplicate Your previous choices and lose chances to guess.
